<h3>Finian's Rainbow</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite musicals! I love the crossover between life in the American South and Irish folklore.</p>

<p>This is another one of my favorite musicals! It has a wonderful story, an awesome cast, and fun songs.</p>

<h3>Terrifier 2</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite horror films! I love the 80s flair, the characters, and the suspenseful atmosphere.</p>
